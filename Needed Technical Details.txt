Authentication:
    • User authentication will involve a secure username and password exchange over TCP.
    • Consider hashing algorithms to securely store and verify user credentials.
Communication Protocols:
    • Utilize TCP for reliable communication, ensuring message delivery and order.
    • Implement UDP for real-time interactions, such as broadcasting messages within chat
    rooms.
User Interface:
    • Develop a command-line interface for simplicity and ease of use.
    • Consider adding color-coded messages and user-friendly commands.
    Error Handling:
    • Implement robust error handling mechanisms to manage unexpected scenarios.
    • Provide meaningful error messages for users to understand and troubleshoot issues.
Documentation:
    • Create comprehensive user documentation covering installation, configuration, and usage
    instructions.
    • Include technical documentation detailing the system architecture, communication
    protocols, and codebase structure.
Testing:
    • Conduct thorough unit testing for each implemented feature.
    • Perform integration testing to ensure seamless interactions between different components.
    • Consider stress testing to evaluate the system's performance under high loads.
Scalability:
    • Design the system to be scalable, accommodating an increasing number of users and chat
    rooms.
    • Optimize data structures and algorithms for efficient resource utilization.

Phase 4: One-to-One Chatting and Protocol Optimization

1. Objective: Enhance the application by enabling one-to-one chatting and optimizing
communication protocols for better performance.

2. Deliverables:

• Implement one-to-one chat functionality.
• Optimize TCP and UDP usage based on different scenarios.
• Conduct performance testing and document results.
• Finalize the user interface and overall user experience.

Steps:

• Implement one-to-one chat functionality between users.
• Optimize communication protocols based on different scenarios (e.g., TCP for reliability,
UDP for real-time interactions).
• Conduct performance testing to evaluate the scalability of the system.
• Finalize the user interface, considering usability and user experience.
